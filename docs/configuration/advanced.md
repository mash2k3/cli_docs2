# Advanced Settings

Configure advanced and debug options.

---

## System & Logging

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Logging Level** | `DEBUG` | Logging level for console output and file logging |
| **Timezone Override** | — | Override system timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`). Leave empty to use system timezone. |
| **Check For Updates** | On | Check for updates and display update indicator in the header |
| **Enable Tracemalloc** | Off | Enable Python's tracemalloc for detailed memory usage tracking per task. Adds overhead — use only for debugging memory leaks. |
| **Tracemalloc Sample Rate** | `100` | Sample rate for tracemalloc (1 in X tasks). Lower values give more frequent data but increase overhead. |

## Library Management

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Skip Initial Plex Update** | Off | Skip Plex initial collection scan on startup |
| **Enable Plex Removal Caching** | On | Enable caching of Plex removal operations before executing them |
| **Plex Removal Cache Delay (Minutes)** | `360` | Delay in minutes before processing a cached Plex removal operation |
| **Cinesync Path** | — | Absolute path to your CineSync MediaHub `main.py` file |
| **Enable Unmatched Items Check** | On | Enable checking and fixing of unmatched or incorrectly matched items in Plex during collection scans |
| **Enable Library Maintenance Task** | Off | Run the library maintenance task periodically. This is a destructive process — use with caution. |
| **NAS / Network Drive Paths** | — | One or more path prefixes identifying NAS or network drive locations (e.g. `/MySamsungNAS_Movies/`). Used to detect and optionally filter NAS items in the Library, Debrid Manager Audit, and Debug Functions. If left empty, smart detection is used as a fallback in the Audit tab. |

!!! tip "NAS Paths"
    Add one entry per NAS prefix. The prefix should match the start of the `location_on_disk` path stored in the database. Common examples:

    | Path in database | Prefix to add |
    |---|---|
    | `/192.168.1.124_Movies/Passengers.mkv` | `/192.168.1.124_Movies/` |
    | `/mnt/nas/movies/Passengers.mkv` | `/mnt/nas/` |
    | `/mnt/nas/movies/Passengers.mkv` | `/mnt/nas/movies/` |
    | `/movies/Passengers.mkv` | `/movies/` |
    | `/NAS/Media/Passengers.mkv` | `/NAS/` |

    You can be as specific or broad as needed — `/mnt/nas/` would match both `/mnt/nas/movies/` and `/mnt/nas/shows/`. Check your database entries in the **Library** or **Database** pages to see the exact paths being used.
